# C Programming Language

## Why Learning C

Learning C is very helpful and sometimes a core prerequisite if we want to have deep understanding of the systems we work in. For example, fluency in C is a must to understand TCP/IP stack, syscall interface for any OS, as well as most databases and distributed systems. Below are few reasons why learning C is worthwhile investment:

- It is still one of the most commonly used languages in systems: databases, OS, distributed systems, TCP/IP stack, etc.
- Câ€™s influence can be seen in many modern languages such as Python
- C helps you think like a computer by helping develop a firm mental model of how the computer actually work
- Most tools for writing software are written in C (or C++)

## Objective

After learning C, I would like to:

- Write complex software in C
- Understand the compiling process
- Improve my debugging skills using `gdb`
- Understand linking and loading process
- Understand memory allocation
- Data representation
